<h1>Hi, I'm Mara Elisa Bujor ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>
  I'm a Web Development student at SRH in Berlin. I'm passionate about building thoughtful and accessible digital experiences â€” whether through hands-on coding or user-focused design. My work blends creativity and logic, and I enjoy collaborating on meaningful projects that make tech more human.
</p>

<p>
  So far, Iâ€™ve worked on projects using JavaScript, React, SQL, Figma, ProtoPie, and Strapi â€” always learning and always improving. Below are a few highlights from my university journey.
</p>

  <h2> Deeply â€” A Meditation App for Teens</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Project type:</strong> University collaboration with a high school in Hamburg<br>
    <strong>Tools used:</strong> Figma, HTML/CSS, GitHub
  </p>

  <p>
    Deeply is a design concept for a meditation and mindfulness app, created during a university project aimed at helping teenagers deal with stress and mental health challenges.
  </p>

  <p>
    We worked in groups to explore different topics related to teens wellbeing. My group focused on meditation. After brainstorming ideas and doing some basic user research, I designed my own landing page concept for the app.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal was to keep the landing page calming, clear, and youth-friendly. I focused on clean layout, soft visuals, and intuitive navigation. The page includes an overview of the app's features, visual elements that reflect a peaceful vibe, and simple calls to action.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>My contribution:</strong> I created the landing page design based on our group concept. I worked with Figma to design the layout and mood of the page, then built a simple static version using HTML and CSS.

  <h3>Edurino Game Teaser Page</h3>
  <p>
    This challenge asked us to create a teaser page for a game idea that could appeal to both children and their parents â€” something you'd see on a shelf in a toy store. I chose a bold color palette inspired by Edurinoâ€™s branding and focused on a clear visual split: the top half for parents (with key educational benefits) and the lower half for kids (with links to playful mini-games).
  </p>
  <p>
    It was an exercise in communicating to two very different audiences at once â€” which made it both fun and insightful.

  <h3>Handycap App â€“ Accessible Events Platform</h3>
  <p>
    This full-stack app helps people with disabilities find and attend accessible events. I worked on the frontend using Next.js and connected it to a custom Strapi CMS with multilingual support and user role management.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was the first time I worked on a real content structure and user data flow â€” and it made me appreciate how much thought goes into accessibility.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Tools used:</strong> Strapi, Next.js, CSS</p>
